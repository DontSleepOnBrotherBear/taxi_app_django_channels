Why sometimes is it:
    # Rider receives message.
    response = await communicator.receive_json_from()
    assert response == message

and other times it's: 

    # Rider receives message.
    response = await channel_layer.receive('test_channel')
    response_data = response.get('data')
    assert response_data['id'] == trip_id


In the first example, the communicator, aka the WebsocketCommunicator class function receive_json_from() method is used to collect
a message that was sent to the channel.

In the second example, the channel_layer object itself is ised to collect the message. 

What's the difference?
